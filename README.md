## Description

Motivation for developing this project was to get a better understanding of the basics for starting out my coding journey. 
I built this as way to show myself that I can learn coding and use the tools given to me to develop the knowledge to move forwards. 
This helps me develope a template and guide for starting my coding journey from nothing. 
I learned I have a lot longer to go in developing tools and understanding.
